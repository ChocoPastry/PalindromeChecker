# Palindrome Checker

This simple C program checks if a given number is a palindrome.

## Usage

1. **Enter a Number**
    ```
    Enter a number: <your_number>
    ```

Replace `<your_number>` with the numeric value you want to check for palindromicity.

## Example

1. Check if 121 is a palindrome:
    ```
    Enter a number: 121
    ```

    Output:
    ```
    It's a palindrome
    ```

2. Check if 456 is a palindrome:
    ```
    Enter a number: 456
    ```

    Output:
    ```
    It's not a palindrome
    ```

## Build and Run

To compile the program, use a C compiler such as GCC:
```bash
gcc palindrome_checker.c -o palindrome_checker
```

Run the compiled program:
```bash
./palindrome_checker
```
